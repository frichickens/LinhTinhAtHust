Chapter 3: ISA
Instructions

Ex1. Explain the role of the funct3 and funct7 fields of the R-format instructions?


Ex2. Explain the differences between the S and SB instruction formats.


Ex3. Write a RISC-V assembly program to do the following:
Input an integer from console (using the ecall instruction).
Calculate the sum of all digits of that integer.
Print the calculated sum value to console (using the ecall function).


Ex4. Write a RISC-V assembly program to do the following:
Read an integer N from console.
Then read N integers from console.
Find and print the values of the smallest and largest number from the N integers that have been read.


Ex5. Write a RISC-V assembly program to do the following
Implement an AVG() function that accepts 2 integers as input, then calculate and return a 32-bit floating point number with the value equal to the average value of the two input.
Using the above AVG() function, write a program that continuously reads 2 integers A and B from console and printout the average values of these 2 integers. The process only finishes in case both values of A and B are 0.


Ex6: Try rewrite the programs in Ex4 and Ex5 with instructions from the compact instruction set RV32C.
